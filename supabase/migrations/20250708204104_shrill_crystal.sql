  # Fix RLS policies for content saving from TMDB

  This migration addresses the RLS policy violation when saving TMDB content to the database.
  
  ## Problem
  The current RLS policies only allow admin users to INSERT/UPDATE content in movies and tv_shows tables,
  but the application needs to save TMDB content when users interact with search results.
  
  ## Solution
  1. Add service role policies for content saving operations
  2. Add policies for authenticated users to save content from TMDB
  3. Ensure the application can auto-save content while maintaining security
  
  ## Changes
  - Add service role INSERT/UPDATE policies for movies and tv_shows tables
  - Add authenticated user policies for content saving (with restrictions)
  - Add policies for content_providers table operations
  
  ## Security Notes
  - Service role policies allow the application backend to save content
  - Authenticated user policies are restricted to prevent abuse
  - Admin policies remain unchanged for full management access
